## What is CRM?

 CRMs are a tool that almost every sales team uses to track prospective and existing customers through the sales process.
 
 CRMs should allow us to:
 
 - Track Leads (people whose contact info we have gathered but who may or may not be interested in our product).
 
 - Convert Leads into Opportunities (leads are converted into opportunities when they show interest in buying the product).
 
  - Associate an Opportunity with an Account.
    
  - Associate Contacts with an Opportunity.
 
## How does the program work?

It is very easy, you can call any of these **commands**:

**NEW LEAD** -> Add Lead to the CRM system

**SHOW LEADS** -> Display a list of all the LEADS' id and name

**SHOW CONTACTS** -> Display a list of all the CONTACTS' id and name

**SHOW OPPORTUNITIES** -> Display a list of all the OPPORTUNITIES' id and name of the decision maker

**SHOW ACCOUNTS** -> Display a list of all the ACCOUNTS id and name of the first contact

**LOOKUP LEAD (ID)** -> Display the selected LEAD's details with the indicated Id Number

**LOOKUP ACCOUNT (ID)** -> Display the selected ACCOUNT's details with the indicated Id Number

**LOOKUP OPPORTUNITY (ID)** -> Display the selected OPPORTUNITY's details with the indicated Id Number

**LOOKUP CONTACT (ID)** -> Display the selected CONTACT's details with the indicated Id Number

**CONVERT (ID)** -> Converts the selected LEAD in CONTACT, OPPORTUNITY and ACCOUNT and removes it from the system

**CLOSE LOST (ID)** -> Changes the selected ACCOUNT status to CLOSE-LOST

**CLOSE WON (ID)** -> Changes the selected ACCOUNT status to CLOSE-WON

**QUIT** -> Terminates the CRM system

### IMPORTANT!
_If at any time you need to look up some of these commands during the program, you can use the HELP command._
